# geemap-demo
Short demonstration of geemap :  https://geemap.org/. This package is developped by Qiusheng Wu : https://wetlands.io/

Need to install geemap, and eventually to create a google account (to access their database).

(04/05/2023) After installing geemap, you'll need to downgrade ipyleaflet if you want to export maps in html format (see [this link](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet/issues/841)).
